# shorthanddictation
Dictation program, which uses the unit **syllables per minute** (SPM) as a reading speed unit. Made primarily for excercising shorthand writing speed. Speed can be adjusted from 20 to 100 SPM. The program was made with only the German language in mind. For other languages the rules for the syllable counting function have to be adjusted accordingly.

### For Mac users
I had problems with the speed of reading when switching to macOS. I created a different branch which uses the built in *say* function and works wonderfully on my machine.
